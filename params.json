  "body": "# Patchman\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nPatchman is a django-based patch status monitoring tool for linux systems. Patchman provides a web interface for monitoring the package updates available for linux hosts.\r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\n\r\nPatchman clients send a list of installed packages and enabled repositories to the Patchman server. The Patchman server updates its package list for each repository and determines which hosts require updates, and whether those updates\r\nare normal or security updates. The web interface also gives information on potential issues, such as installed packages that are not from any repository.\r\n\r\nHosts, packages, repositories and operating systems can all be filtered. For example, it is possible to find out which hosts have a certain version of a package installed, and which repository it comes from.\r\n\r\nPatchman does not install update packages on hosts, it determines and displays what updates are available for each host.\r\n\r\n`yum` and `apt` plugins can send reports to the Patchman server every time packages are installed or removed on a host.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Source\r\n\r\nThe current source code is available on github:\r\n\r\n   https://github.com/furlongm/patchman\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n### Server-side Dependencies\r\n\r\n```\r\npython-django-tagging\r\npython-django-extensions\r\npython-django-bootstrap3\r\npython-debian\r\npython-rpm\r\npython-progressbar\r\npython-lxml\r\npython-argparse\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe server can optionally make use of celery to asynchronously process the reports sent by hosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Client-side dependencies\r\n\r\nThe client-side dependencies are kept to a minimum. `rpm` and `dpkg` are required to report packages, `yum` and `apt` are required to report repositories. These packages are normally installed by default on most systems.\r\n\r\nrpm-based OS's can tell if a reboot is required to install a new kernel by looking at `uname -r` and comparing it to the highest installed kernel version.\r\n\r\ndeb-based OS's do not always change the kernel version when a kernel update is installed, so the `update-notifier-common` package needs to be installed to enable this functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe web interface contains a dashboard with items that need attention, and various pages to manipulate hosts, repositories, packages, operating systems and reports.\r\n\r\nTo populate the database, simply run the client on some hosts - `patchman-client -s http://patchman.example.org`. This should provide some initial data to work with.\r\n\r\nOn the server, the `patchman` command line utility can be used to run certain maintenance tasks, e.g. processing the reports sent from hosts, downloading repository update information from the web. Run `patchman -h` for a rundown of the usage.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Concepts\r\n\r\nThe default settings will be fine for most people but depending on your setup, there may be some initial work required to logically organise the data sent in the host reports. The following explanations may help in this case.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of basic objects - Hosts, Repositories, Packages, Operating Systems and Reports. There are also Operating System Groups (which are optional) and Mirrors.\r\n\r\n### Host\r\nA Host is a single host, e.g. test01.example.org.\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\nA Host runs an Operating System, e.g. CentOS 7.1, Debian 8.4, Ubuntu 16.04\r\n\r\n### Package\r\nA Package is a package that is either installed on a Host, or is available to download from a Repository mirror, e.g. `strace-4.8-11.el7.x86_64`, `grub2-tools-2.02-0.34.el7.centos.x86_64`, etc.\r\n\r\n### Mirror\r\nA Mirror is a collection of Packages available on the web, e.g. a `yum` or `apt` repo.\r\n\r\n### Repository\r\nA Repository is a collection of Mirrors. Typically all the Mirrors will contain the same Packages. For Red Hat-based Hosts, Repositories automatically link their Mirrors together. For Debian-based hosts, you may need to link all Mirrors that form a Repository using the web interface in order to reduce the time to find updates.\r\n\r\n### Report\r\nA Host creates a Report using `patchman-client`. This Report is sent to the Patchman server. The Report contains the Host's Operating System, and lists of the installed Packages and enabled Repositories on a Host. The Patchman server processes and records the list of Packages and Repositories contained in the Report.\r\n\r\n### Operating System Group (optional)\r\nAn OSGroup is a collection of OS's. For example, an OSGroup named \"Debian 8\" OSGroup would be comprised of the following OS's:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDebian 8.0\r\nDebian 8.1\r\nDebian 8.4\r\n``\r\n\r\nLikewise, an OSGroup named \"CentOS 7\" OSGroup could be made up of the following OS's:\r\n\r\n``\r\nCentOS 7.0\r\nCentOS 7.2.1511\r\n``\r\n\r\nRepositories can be associated with an OSGroup, or with the Host itself. If the `use_host_repos variable` is set to True for a Host, then updates are found by looking only at the Repositories that belong to that Host. This is the default behaviour and does not require OSGroups to be configured.\r\n\r\nIf `use_host_repos` is set to False, the update-finding process looks at the OSGroup that the Host's Operating System is in, and uses the OSGroup's Repositories to determine the applicable updates. This is useful in environments where many hosts are homogeneous (e.g. cloud/cluster environments).",
